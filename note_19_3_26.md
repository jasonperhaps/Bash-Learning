# Notes of Learning Bash

## Working with Bash history

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/date-03.26.2019-informational.svg)

This command allows multiple terminal sessions to write to the history at the same time.

    shopt -s histappend
    
This command will run sudo and then the entirely of the previous command.    

    sudo !!

Similar but used much less frequently is the !* shortcut which tells bash you want all of 
the arguments from the previous command to be repeated int the current command.
    
    touch file1 file2 file3 file4
    chmod 777 !*

Display the most-used commands in your history.    
    
    history | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[ \t]+|\\"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
    
Run **git pull** command in all repostories in current directory. 
    
    find . -maxdepth 4 -name .git -type d | rev | cut -c 6- | rev | xargs -I {} git -C {} pull
